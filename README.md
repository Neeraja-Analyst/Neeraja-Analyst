# Hello, I'm Neeraja! 👋

I'm a passionate data analyst with hands-on experience in **supply chain analytics** and **market research**. Over the past 6 months, I've been working as an **SCM Analyst at Scimplify**, where I automated dashboards for **EXIM operations, logistics tracking, open orders**, and **daily warehouse movements** using **Power BI** and **Google Sheets** to support real-time, data-driven decision-making.

In addition, I built the **"Dynamic Warehouse-to-Customer Route Optimizer"** project at **Scimplify** using **Python, JSON, HTML, and CSS**. This tool identifies the most efficient delivery path from a warehouse to multiple customer locations using real-time map interaction and optimal routing logic.

Previously, I interned at **Scimplify** as a **Market Research Analyst**, where I conducted research on specialty chemical markets, cleaned large datasets, and extracted insights to support growth strategies. My work contributed to a better understanding of customer needs, competitor activities, and market opportunities.
